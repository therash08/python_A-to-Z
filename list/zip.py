# # The zip() function returns a zip object, which is an iterator of tuples where the first item in each passed
# #  iterator is paired together, and then the second item in each passed iterator are paired together.

# # If the passed iterators have different lengths, the iterator with the least items decides the length of the new iterator.

# # Write a program to add items of 2 lists indexwise

# L1 = [1,2,3,4]
# L2 = [1,2,3,4]

# L = list(zip(L1,L2)) 
# print(L)


# L1 = [i+j for i,j in zip(L1,L2)]
# print(L1)

L = [1,2, print,type,input]
print(L)
